# Flex

- Once we use position:flex, it is not a block anymore
- justify-content: Apply contents horizontally
- align-items: Apply contents vertically
- flex-direction
- flex-wrap: no-wrap: Break the boxes

However, if flex-direction: column, `justify-content` works vertically and `align-items` works horizontally

- Flexbox should be applied in parents, not children
